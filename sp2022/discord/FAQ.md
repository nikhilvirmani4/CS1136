FAQ-


- What is required of me in this class?  

Read the assignment instructions before the lab session, attend the 45-minute lab session and submit the HW before the due date. It's that simple! (you are going to wish that all your classes were this straightforward when you are done with this course)

- What is the attendance policy?  

The 45-minute session allocated for your group contributes to a part of your grade. 100 points are reserved for your attendance over the semester. You may be absent for three classes throughout the semester without negatively affecting your attendance points. Of course, you are free to stay in the labs outside of the 45 minutes as well. Attendance policy is subject to change. 

 - What kind of support is available to me?  

Aside from the in-person lab sessions, UGTA and GTA will also offer virtual support. To know about the support hours, find the related document in the resources channel. Outside of these hours, you can post your query in virtual-support and someone will reply to you when they are able to. 

 - What can I do during the lab sessions?  

Ideally, you should be getting to know the people in your group while working on the lab that's due. If you've already completed the lab, you are free to work on your own stuff, and perhaps even help others out. 

 - Is there any bonus?  

No, the required work makes up all of the points. Ignore the instructions about bonuses in zyLabs. 

 - Do you guys support 1336 as well?  

While we don't officially support 1336 (the CSMC does), we are happy to help with anything to the best of our ability.
- What's this UGTA program? 

Alongside the graduate TAs, the Undergraduate Teaching Assistants will be providing you with unprecedented support for this course. One of our primary goals is to make sure that everyone feels welcome in the class and to make it as easy as possible to seek assistance with the material. Since many of you are still new to UTD, we also aim to provide you with tips and tricks where applicable. This being the first semester since UGTA's inception, we ask for your input on how you think this program can be utilized to improve the experience in this class in the future.
