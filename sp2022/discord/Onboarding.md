Discord Polls:



Hi guys, you may have noticed a poll that was sent out earlier. If you would like to send a poll to your groups (so they can vote on team names or for any other reason), here are the steps to do so on your computer:



How To Create & Send Out a Discord Poll:



1.) Go to the channel you would like to message. Go to the message bar to type text. 

2.) Type the following command:
/poll 
then select the /poll command option.



3.) Next, it will prompt you to type your question after a box which contains “question:”. Once you have finished typing your poll’s question/message, press the ‘tab’ key on your keyboard to lock it in. 



4.) Discord will then open up Options from A - T. Select an option, perhaps “choice_a”, then input the message you want for that poll option/choice. Once you have finished typing the text for the choice, press the ‘tab’ key on your keyboard again. You can continue this process for as many choices you want to provide. 



5.) Once you have finished inputting all your choices, you can send out the poll by pressing your keyboard’s ‘return’ key or the send button. Your poll will then be available to those in your group. You may want to @the members in your group to notify them or @the role you’ve created with the group members. If you are only trying to ask your group something, try not to use @everyone as it will alert all 300+ users in the server.



Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
